    <h4>
My Experience
    </h4>

<p>Having moved back from the U.S.A recently, i took it upon myself to learn coding with the help of <a href="https://codelancashire.tech/">Code Lancashire,</a> 
    in search of a new career, previously i was in the yachting and hospitality industry's, see below for my career so far!

<p>Yachting Industry (MY Element, Sarafsa and Enterprise) <br> June 2020 - March 2023 / Chief Officer
</p>

<p> <details>
    I flew to the South of France in June 2020 without a job
and it took me 8 days to land my first full time role in the
superyacht industry with no prior experience.
I started out as a deckhand, working in a team of 6
looking after the exterior of the superyacht, and also
taking the owner to and from shore via a 10m tender
often in high pressured weather conditions.
Within two years i landed a job as Chief Officer where i
dealt with the safety aspects onboard, crew
documentation, crew wellbeing, route planning and also
managing a team of 1 to 6 deckhands on the deck itself.
In 2022 i was put in charge of an atlantic ocean crossing
on the dockwise express, on 24 hour call along the 2
week route from Genoa to Fort Lauderdale.
This time in the yachting industry grew my interpersonal
and team building skills as i was dealing with crew,
guests and owners from all different nationalities and
backgrounds
I would often help the interior team with service if they
were a crew member down, in such situations it taught
me how important is is to have a multi skilled team, as
the superyacht industry can be notoriously demanding,
it was vital for me and my team to be able to analyse and
anticipate specific situations quickly and efficiently.

<p>Events and Communications Manager <br>
    2012 - 2015 at Campbell & Rowley Events Management</p>

<p><details>In the role as Senior events and Communications
    Manager i would plan events on an internal software
    system where i would include every detail you needed to
    create events of all types, from 1 to 20,000 attendees
    Along with the paperwork side to the job, I would also be
    in charge of setup, service and clear-down for large
    scale events including 1000+ attendees at business
    awards/corporate dinners, along with a variety of
    sporting venues
    On the largest events i would be in charge of around 100
    employees, on such occasions working closely with
    clients such as Singer Camilla Cabello, and the head of
    hospitality for Manchester United
    From the start of the process i would liaise with clients,
    creating their dream event, signing the contract and
    then managing the operation from setup to delivery until
    clear down, these were often very long and demanding
    shifts.</details></p>
