            <h2>Make that change you have been wanting!</h2>
            <p>“Taking the first step, is the hardest part”

                If you are wanting to change something in your life, what better time that now?
                Yes, right now… new years resolutions are a thing of the past, they are just an excuse to push back the reason you are wanting to make a change in the first place.
                If you really want something, the first thing to realise is that life is not going to come to you, but you have to go full attack and fight for what you want!
                The second thing, is believing that you can achieve, I am telling you that you can achieve anything you want to in your lifetime, always remember that Starbucks founder 
                Howard Schultz grew up in a 7th floor apartment with his family, rarely having enough money to pay the bills and WhatsApp founder Jan Koum emigrated to the USA with government aid,
                 eventually sweeping floors at a local supermarket in order to survive, a humbling reminder of what one can achieve!</p>
                 <p>
                    Now, I know life is not about money, and money can’t buy you happiness, but it does give you financial security and the opportunity to 
                    give happiness to others, which are a good foundation of empathy.
For me, fulfilment has always been the key to a happy lifestyle, and pushing boundaries each day to reach my goals is how i achieve so.
Your daily goals may be as small as paying a bill, going on a run or as big as jumping out of an aeroplane over the Palm Jumeirah, but one things for certain,
 and that remains that you have to push yourself to go and do it, if you feel nervous about it… then you should probably do it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    I live by a 5 second rule, and that is related to when you think about something, for example: say it’s as simple as going on a run, you get home from work, its been a rainy day, you know deep down you should go on a run, but you have been thinking about going for 10 seconds now, your mind is already thinking of excuses as of why not to go, its human nature, after 30 seconds you give in and you find some stupid excuse like “Its raining” instead you find comfort sitting inside all night playing video games, staring into a screen and not doing anything productive that you wanted to in the first place, at the end of the day you say “yeah I will probably go on a run tomorrow”, but you repeat the toxic cycle over and over again, when are you actually going to make a change?
It’s a slippery slope, and its made even harder in a modern world of instant gratification through social media, our brains get clogged up and are way too distracted, at this point, consider looking at your notifications tabs, or putting all your social media icons into a folder, and remember why you put them there in the first place.
So back to the title, the first step is always the hardest part, because when you are running in the rain, embracing the elements and your endorphins are being released, the second step, third step, five hundredth step are made so easy, its one challenge smashed for the day, and trust me when I say, you will be naturally willing to want to achieve more, which makes you feel great, and sets examples to others around you.
My main point being, if you think about something, attack it within the first five seconds of thinking about it, you are going to do it, so attack your goals, don’t let your mental barrier tell you otherwise, take that first step today, not tomorrow!
