            <h2>But why?</h2>
            <p>Since I published my first blog post on Facebook “How I turned my 2020 into a positive one” I was blown away by the reaction it received, 
                the feedback that flooded in gave me a new found belief, the belief that I had reiterated my initial point, you can really achieve what you want 
                to, if you put your mind to it.</p>
                <p>
                    So, what am I trying to achieve?
Firstly, this is mostly for you, the reader.
If you choose to let your mind focus and finish any of my blogs, hopefully, I will inspire and educate you with some positive thoughts that will improve your day.
Life gets so busy these days, we lose sight of the real meaningful things and are easily distracted by the artificial intelligence that is carefully managed to capture our attention at every glance on our smart devices.
The average human spends 3 hours and 15 minutes on their phones every day, and for many of us, a large proportion of that time would be on social media, scrolling through meaningless targeted ads manipulating our brains.
So, my point is, if you allow me to open your mind and give you some fresh inspiration from the heart, that’s real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, a couple of the comments were touting me as a journalist, never in my life had I even considered myself to be intelligent enough to write a few sentences, I struggled to get to grips with the classic “Of Mice and Men” during my GCSEs!
But hey, here I am giving life my best shot, because what is the point in being alive if you don’t at least try to do something remarkable?
Thirdly and finally, I am in a good headspace right now, and it just feels like the right time to take on a side challenge, its something that keeps me ticking on the side and fills up the time I would usually be sweating out some Call of Duty, buying loot boxes with real money for no other reason than thinking I needed that Gold Camo for my 50 Cal sniper, literally buying pixels, or scrolling through social media needlessly subconsciously comparing my life to others.
So, in the end, it’s a win/win for us both, and there’s why.
Here’s to the journey, I hope to see you along the way.
